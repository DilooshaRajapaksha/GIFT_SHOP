GIFT_SHOP (GiftCraft)

**E-commerce website for a gift shop named "GiftCraft".**

GiftCraft is a full-stack e-commerce web application designed to make gift shopping simple and delightful.  
It allows users to browse unique gifts, view detailed product information, and share reviews — while admins can manage the catalog easily.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

GiftCraft is developed as a **team project** with multiple modules working together:

- 🧍‍♀️ **User Management** – Handles authentication and user roles (Login, Register, etc.)
- 🎁 **Product Management** – Manages products, categories, and reviews (My part)
- 🎨 **Gift Box Customization** – Allows customers to create personalized gift boxes
- 📦 **Order Management** – Handles shopping cart, checkout, and order tracking
